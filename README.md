# LeetCode-Problems
This is a set of solutions for LeetCode problems that I have solved. The solutions will mainly be in C, C++ and Python. They will be in the exact format as the LeetCode template for that problem (int that particular language). Comments will bew included to explain the solution, and tests for the solutions are also provided (although running it on LeetCode may be easiest). Anyone using the solution is free to add tests as they see fit.
